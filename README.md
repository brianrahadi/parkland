This is an academic project built in a group of 4. Some of the codes might not written with a best practice in mind due to some of the members having the first exposure to web development in this course. However, I have learned a great deal in how to make a full-stack web application.

My personal accomplishments included, but not limited to:
-	Implemented all the frontend, backend, and databases of the rides review system for full CRUD functionality
- Developed 39 test cases using Mocha and Chai to ensure database retrieval run smoothly
-	Fixed the layout of the homepage, user, and admin dashboard with CSS Flexbox

Currently, Website is down due to issues with Heroku. However, I have the demo video listed here.
